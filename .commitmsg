Stabilize Prism Procrustes and skip existing artifacts
- Remove redundant SVD polish in fit_prism_Q; Q=U V^T is sufficient and avoids CPU SVD non-convergence on near-orthogonal Q (observed on Qwen3-8B)
- Add QR orthonormalization fallback when orthogonality error is high or non-finite; keep float32 numerics
- Update provenance notes to reflect Procrustes path and QR fallback
- prism_fit: skip model when artifacts already exist unless --force; add --force flag and treat "exists" as success for single-model runs
- Tests not run in this environment (venv lacks torch); behavior covered by existing Prism unit tests
