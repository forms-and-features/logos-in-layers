You're a top LLM interpretability researcher at a leading AI lab (think OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You're guiding and consulting an experiment that aims to apply the results of LLM interpretability research to push forward the philosophical debate between nominalism and realism. This is a "hobby" project of a software engineers just getting started with interpretability, but interested in using LLM interpretability to push the debate as far as possible with the tools available.

We are analysing layer-by-layer logit-lens sweeps over ten open-weight base LLMs (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Meta-Llama-3-70B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Mistral-Small-24B-Base-2501, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-27B, Qwen-3-8B, Qwen-3-14B, Qwen2.5-72B, Yi-34B).

With the help of an AI co-pilot, the user ran experiments on a few open-weights models:
- the python script: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forms-and-features/logos-in-layers/refs/heads/main/001_layers_baseline/run.py

- structured output of the script for each of the models in JSON (model-level results) and CSV (detailed layer-by-layer results) files. Some runs may also include Prism sidecar CSVs and a `diagnostics.prism_summary` block in JSON for calibration comparison:

If Prism sidecars are present in the run (calibration overlay), they will appear as additional CSVs per model:

… and similarly for other models. JSON files include `diagnostics.prism_summary` when Prism was active.

If Tuned‑Lens sidecars are present in the run (learned calibration overlay), they will appear as additional CSVs per model:

JSON files include a `tuned_lens` block (status/path/summaries/provenance), and diagnostics mirror tuned summaries (e.g., `L_surface_to_meaning_tuned`, `L_geom_tuned`, `L_topk_decay_tuned`). Note: `kl_to_final_bits_norm_temp` is norm‑only and may be blank in tuned CSVs.

If present for a model, also include Full Raw‑vs‑Norm sidecar, they will appear as additional CSVs per moidel:

Your task is to:
- review the experiment's code: anything wrong about the approach (other than limitations highlighted in model evaluation docs)?
- review the results and analyses: anything incorrectly interpreted, over-stated, or missed?
- do your own independent deep dive into the results, broadly following the structure of cross-model evaluation reports, and using your knowledge of latest LLM interpretability research (you may use search for articles, posts and code sources);
- consider the usefulness of the findings for the realism vs nominalism debate, keeping in mind this is just the first iteration;
- review the plan in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forms-and-features/logos-in-layers/refs/heads/main/001_LAYERS_BASELINE_PLAN.md and, if necessary, propose additions and/or adjustments to the next steps, keeping in mind project context and goals; make sure that suggestions would actually bring non-negligible value to the project (no bike-shedding!).

Use your knowledge of cutting-edge LLM research. Look up and read papers, if necessary.

Be thorough and specific - this is important.

Make sure that statements are supported by evidence from the txt dump, don't speculate. Contextualize your findings using your broader knowledge of the latest interpretability research, citing sources when appropriate. Always provide links to sources, and verify that sources contain the claims that you're citing; otherwise, reformulate or remove the claim. In any case, never provide a non-existent source.

Do not use tables unless for the cases explicitly requested in this prompt.

Known limitations of the approach that we accepted in this iteration (but suggestions are appreciated):

The script:
* **Applies each model's own normaliser** with architecture-aware selection before unembed. Pre-norm models use the next block's ln1 (or ln_final at the end) for post-block probes; post-norm use the current block's ln2. LN/RMS statistics are computed in fp32 (RMS ε inside sqrt), then cast back to the residual dtype.
* **Defines copy-collapse (L_\copy) by prompt-echo**: the first layer whose top-1 *next-token* (or a k=1 window) forms an ID-level contiguous subsequence of the prompt's token IDs with **p > 0.95** and margin **p1 − p2 > 0.10**. No entropy fallback; whitespace/punctuation top‑1s are ignored. Provenance fields are present in diagnostics (`copy_thresh`, `copy_window_k`, `copy_match_level`). Soft detectors (`L_copy_soft[k]`) reuse the same ID rule with a softer τ (default 0.33/0.50) and window sizes from `copy_soft_config.window_ks`.
* **Defines semantic-collapse (L_\semantic)** as the first layer where the gold answer’s first ID is rank 1 (answer_rank==1) under the lens; falls back to string match if rank is unavailable.  Δ-collapse = L_\semantic − L_\copy captures how long the model clings to surface form before retrieving meaning; soft deltas (Δ_soft[k]) compare against `L_copy_soft[k]`.
* Uses the positive prompt
  `Give the city name only, plain text. The capital of Germany is called simply`
  and also runs (i) a no_filler ablation variant ("… is called") and (ii) a France→Paris control. The depth summaries focus on `prompt_id=pos, prompt_variant=orig` for comparability; ablation deltas are reported in `ablation_summary`.
* Runs on the device selected by `--device` (default **auto**, which picks cuda → mps → cpu by fit). Normalisation math runs in fp32 but residuals are cached in the model’s compute dtype. The unembedding is shadow‑promoted to fp32 for analysis when compute is bf16/fp16 (or via `--fp32-unembed`). The run is deterministically seeded (`SEED = 316`). Early-layer decoded tokens may be garbled; treat these artefacts as noise.
* Outputs per model: a JSON meta file (diagnostics + summary, including `copy_flag_columns`, `copy_soft_config`, `L_copy_soft`, `delta_layers_soft`, `last_layer_consistency`, control, and ablation blocks; plus surface/geometry/coverage summaries and norm‑temp snapshots), a records CSV, and a pure‑next‑token CSV (one row per layer). The pure CSV includes existing flags (`copy_collapse`, `copy_strict@τ`, `copy_soft_k{1,2,3}@τ_soft`, `entropy_collapse`, `is_answer`) and also:
  – **Surface mass**: `echo_mass_prompt`, `answer_mass`, `answer_minus_echo_mass`, `mass_ratio_ans_over_prompt`
  – **Geometry**: `cos_to_answer`, `cos_to_prompt_max`, `geom_crossover`
  – **Coverage**: `topk_prompt_mass@50`
  – **Norm temperature (norm‑only)**: `kl_to_final_bits_norm_temp` = KL(P(z/τ) || P_final)
  – Existing: `p_top1`, `p_top5`, `p_answer`, `answer_rank`, `kl_to_final_bits`, `cos_to_final`, `control_margin`
  Evaluation markdown files are also written under `run-latest/`.

Known limitations to keep in mind:

* RMS-lens can distort absolute probabilities; comparisons should stay within-model, not across differing normalisation schemes.
* Single-prompt probing risks over-fitting to tokenizer quirks; copy-collapse counts may swing if we tweak wording or punctuation.
* Attention patterns and MLP activations are not inspected—only residual projections—so entropy bumps caused by internal gating may be mis-attributed.

Accept these constraints as *scoping guards*: they keep this run self-consistent even if they leave some systematic bias uncorrected.

Your response should read as a review, not as part of a conversation. DO NOT refer to user as "you", or to yourself as "I" - everything in the review MUST be in third person. The review should be in valid markdown format. Respond with review only and nothing else, no dialogue.
