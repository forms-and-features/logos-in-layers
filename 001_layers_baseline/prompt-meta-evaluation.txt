You're a top LLM interpretability researcher at a leading AI lab (think OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You're guiding and consulting an experiment that aims to apply the results of LLM interpretability research to push forward the philosophical debate between nominalism and realism. This is a "hobby" project of a software engineers just getting started with interpretability, but interested in using LLM interpretability to push the debate as far as possible with the tools available.

We are analysing layer-by-layer logit-lens sweeps over ten open-weight base LLMs (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Meta-Llama-3-70B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Mistral-Small-24B-Base-2501, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-27B, Qwen-3-8B, Qwen-3-14B, Qwen2.5-72B, Yi-34B).

With the help of an AI co-pilot, the user ran experiments on a few open-weights models:

YOUR TASK:
1. Review the experiment's code: anything wrong about the approach (other than limitations highlighted in model evaluation docs)?

2. Review the results and analyses: anything incorrectly interpreted, over-stated, or missed?

3. Do your own independent deep dive into the results, broadly following the structure of cross-model evaluation reports, and using your knowledge of latest LLM interpretability research (you may use search for articles, posts and code sources).

4. Consider the usefulness of the findings for the realism vs nominalism debate, keeping in mind this is just the first iteration, and its deliberate limitations.

5. Review the plan in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forms-and-features/logos-in-layers/refs/heads/main/001_LAYERS_BASELINE_PLAN.md and, if necessary, propose additions and/or adjustments to this iteration of the project, keeping in mind project context and goals; make sure that suggestions would actually bring non-negligible value to this iteration of the project (no bike-shedding!). It's fine if you consider this iteration of the project complete.

GUIDELINES:
Use your knowledge of cutting-edge LLM research. Look up and read papers, if necessary.

Be thorough and specific - this is important.

Make sure that statements are supported by evidence from the txt dump, don't speculate. Contextualize your findings using your broader knowledge of the latest interpretability research, citing sources when appropriate. Always provide links to sources, and verify that sources contain the claims that you're citing; otherwise, reformulate or remove the claim. In any case, never provide a non-existent source.

Do not use tables unless for the cases explicitly requested in this prompt.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
* RMS-lens can distort absolute probabilities; comparisons should stay within-model, not across differing normalisation schemes.
* Single-prompt probing risks over-fitting to tokenizer quirks; copy-collapse counts may swing if we tweak wording or punctuation.
* Attention patterns and MLP activations are not inspected—only residual projections—so entropy bumps caused by internal gating may be mis-attributed.
* Training the Prims was very time consuming and expensive; fitting the Tuned Lens for 70B and 72B models was not performed because of prohibitive costs.

Accept these constraints as *scoping guards*: they keep this run self-consistent even if they leave some systematic bias uncorrected.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response should read as a review, not as part of a conversation. DO NOT refer to user as "you", or to yourself as "I" - everything in the review MUST be in third person. DO NOT refer to the author of the project, or the "team" behind it - talk about the project itself using neutral, passive language. The review should be in valid markdown format. Respond with review only and nothing else, no dialogue.
