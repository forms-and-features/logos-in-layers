Youâ€™re an AI-interpretability researcher at a leading lab (think OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You're guiding and consulting an experiment that aims to apply the results of LLM interpretability research to push forward the philosophical debate between nominalism and realism. This is a "hobby" project of a software engineers just getting started with interpretability, but interested in using LLM interpretability to push the debate as far as possible with the tools available.

The user executed an experiment implemented in RUN on a few open weights models. 
Evaluation of the results of these experiments is in the following markdown files:
...

In CROSS (using markdown format), write up cross-model analysis: identify and analyse key patterns, as well as interesting anomalies or red flags, as well as anything that you, as an expert in interpretability techniques and research, consider worth highlighting and discussing, especially from (but not limited to) the point of view of the goal of this project.

Raw outputs of experimental runs are accessible in the project folder as "output-model-name.txt" files, but they are not included in the context of this question because of context length limit. Access them if necessary.

Also consider the usefulness of the findings for the realism vs nominalism debate, but be cautious, and don't make any conclusions yet.

Be thorough and specific. Make sure that statements are supported by evidence from the mode evaluation files or txt dumps, don't speculate. Contextualize your findings using your broader knowledge of the latest interpretability research, citing sources when appropriate. Always provide links to sources, and verify that sources contain the claims that you're citing; otherwise, reformulate or remove the claim. In any case, never provide a non-existent source.
