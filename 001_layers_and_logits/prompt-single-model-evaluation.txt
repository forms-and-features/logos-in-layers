ROLE
You are an interpretability researcher from a top AI research lab (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) advising a hobby project that probes open‑weight LLMs.
You are reviewing results of a probe of one LLM model.

INPUTS
- SCRIPT – source code of the probe's script (for context)
- JSON  – one json file with structured results of the probe (first part of results).
- CSV  - one csv file with detailed layer-level results of the probe (second part of results).
- Your own research knowledge.
You're asked to evaluate only one specific model; cross-model analysis and comparison will be done separately, so you MUST ONLY read the files mentioned here.

TASK
Write EVAL in GitHub‑flavoured Markdown with the sections below **in order**.  
Stick to empirical evidence from CSV, JSON and SCRIPT; no extra inference.
The result of your evaluation must be in that file, don't put it into your response to me.

1. Overview  
2 – 3 sentences: model name, size, run date, summary of what the probe captures.

2. Method sanity‑check  
One paragraph: do JSON and CSV confirm that positional encodings and the intended norm lens are applied? Quote ≤ 2 console lines with line numbers.

3. Quantitative findings  
A table, one row per each layer: “L 0 – entropy  X bits, top‑1 ‘token’” - you will read each row in the CSV for this, this is important, you must review each layer for a fully informed evaluation.
Bold the first layer where entropy < 1 bit (collapse layer).

4. Qualitative patterns & anomalies  
- Conscise but thorough paragraph for each notable behaviour; use your knowledge of the latest LLM interpretability research; cite sources.
- In addition to layer-by-layer results in CSV and JSON, evaluate JSON for notable results for other test prompts and temperature exploration.
- To support the claims, add a short inline quote + line number, e.g. > “… (‘Berlin’, 0.92)” [L541].
- Checklist (✓/✗/n.a.) at end of section:
    - RMS lens?
    - LayerNorm?
    - Colon‑spam?
    - Entropy rise at unembed?

5. Tentative implications for Realism ↔ Nominalism  
3-4 paragraphs, each phrased as an explicit question or hypothesis. **No conclusions or strong claims.**

6. Limitations & data quirks  
Anything that reduces confidence; keep to facts.

7. Model fingerprint (one sentence)  
Example: “Llama‑3‑8B: collapse at L 32; final entropy 1.8 bits; ‘Paris’ appears rank 2 mid‑stack.”

STYLE GUIDELINES
- Be conscise but thorough.
- Prefer paragraphs over lists.
- Quotes ≤ 2 lines, include line numbers.  
- Cite outside research only if you have the DOI/arXiv number handy (e.g. “Tuned‑Lens 2303.08112”); otherwise omit.  
- Do not speculate beyond JSON and CSV.
