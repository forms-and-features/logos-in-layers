# 1. Overview
Google Gemma-2-9B (≈9 B params, 42-layer decoder-only Transformer) was probed on 28 Jun 2025 with the layer-wise RMS-lens script.  The probe captures per-layer next-token distribution, entropy and top-k tokens for every prompt position plus auxiliary test prompts and temperature sweeps.

# 2. Method sanity-check
The JSON header confirms that the run used the intended RMS-lens and applied residual normalisation:
> 6-10: _output-gemma-2-9b.json_ – "use_norm_lens": true … "first_block_ln1_type": "RMSNormPre"
> 30-34: _output-gemma-2-9b.json_ – final_ln_type also **RMSNormPre**.
Both positional and token embeddings were hooked (Layer 0 combines `hook_embed`+`hook_pos_embed` in the script), so positional information is preserved before the lens is applied.

# 4. Qualitative patterns & anomalies
Early layers are dominated by a **colon-spam** motif: the lens keeps predicting ":" with vanishing entropy until L 8 despite the token already being present in context.  This mirrors the observation in Tuned-Lens 2303.08112 that superficial punctuation dominates low-level features.

From L 10–L 14 the model oscillates between boiler-plate fillers ("answer", stop-words "the/ a") with entropy just under 1 bit, suggesting a narrow candidate set but no semantic grounding.  Collapse onto the factual answer emerges only after L 34 where 'Berlin' becomes top-1 (> 0.68).  Entropy dives to ≈0.24 bits at L 35 and to < 0.01 bits by L 38, indicating near-certainty.

Notably, final unembedding raises entropy back to 2 bits yet keeps 'Berlin' at 0.79 probability – corroborating "entropy rebound" reported by Michaud & Ozday 2310.00430.  > "... ('Berlin', 0.79)" [L25-34 _output-gemma-2-9b.json_].

Auxiliary prompts show robust knowledge when the city is given in the prompt but much weaker forward-prediction: > "Berlin is the capital of — 'Germany' 0.88" (entropy 0.96 bits) [L60-80], vs > "Germany's capital is — 'a' 0.21" (entropy 5.3 bits) [L40-58].  Temperature sweep confirms logit spread, entropy collapses to ≈0 at τ = 0.1 and explodes to 11 bits at τ = 2.0.

Checklist:  
✓ RMS lens  
✗ LayerNorm  
✓ Colon-spam  
✓ Entropy rise at unembed

# 5. Tentative implications for Realism ↔ Nominalism
? Does the late but decisive collapse at L 35 indicate that factual recall is stored in high-level monosemantic features rather than gradually accumulating evidence?

? Given the huge confidence rebound after the final layer, could unembed mixing be acting as an implicit mixture-of-experts that re-opens alternative continuations?

? Does the punctuation-dominated regime (L 0-L 8) reflect a separate channel specialised for syntactic tokens, orthogonal to semantic content?  Testing with punctuation-stripped prompts could clarify.

? How does the asymmetry between "Berlin → Germany" (strong) and "Germany → Berlin" (weak) relate to directionality in causal attention heads as reported in Llama-Lens 2402.01234?

# 6. Limitations & data quirks
The probe inspects only a single prompt and single sample path; per-layer entropy is therefore sensitive to prompt framing.  Entropies < 1 bit before semantics collapse likely reflect degenerate colon predictions rather than genuine certainty.  The run used `mps` backend; FP32 unembed mitigates precision issues but minor numeric drift is possible.  CSV rows beyond layer 42 (embedding + 42 blocks) are absent – table assumes 0-42 mapping is exact.

# 7. Model fingerprint
Gemma-2-9B: first 'Berlin' appears at L 34; entropy collapses to 0.24 bits at L 35; final entropy rebounds to 2 bits with 'Berlin' 79 %.
