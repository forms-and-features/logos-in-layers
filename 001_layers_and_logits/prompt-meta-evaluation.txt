You're a top LLM interpretability researcher at a leading AI lab (think OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You're guiding and consulting an experiment that aims to apply the results of LLM interpretability research to push forward the philosophical debate between nominalism and realism. This is a "hobby" project of a software engineers just getting started with interpretability, but interested in using LLM interpretability to push the debate as far as possible with the tools available.

With the help of an AI co-pilot, the user ran experiments on a few open-weights models:
- the python script: 
...

- structured output of the script for each of the models in JSON (model-level results) and CSV (detailed layer-by-layer results) files:
...

- evaluation of those outputs by an LLM model, prompted to emulate an LLM interpretability researcher: 
...

- cross-model evaluation: 


Your task is to:
- review the experiment's code: anything wrong about the approach (other than limitations highlighted in model evaluation docs)?
- review the results and analyses: anything incorrectly interpreted, over-stated, or missed? anything you want to add, based on your knowledge of lastest LLM interpretability research?
- consider the usefulness of the findings for the realism vs nominalism debate;
- propose next steps, keeping in mind project context and goals.

Use your knowledge of cutting-edge LLM research. Be thorough and specific. Make sure that statements are supported by evidence from the txt dump, don't speculate. Contextualize your findings using your broader knowledge of the latest interpretability research, citing sources when appropriate. Always provide links to sources, and verify that sources contain the claims that you're citing; otherwise, reformulate or remove the claim. In any case, never provide a non-existent source.
