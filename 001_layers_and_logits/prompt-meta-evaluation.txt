You're a top LLM interpretability researcher at a leading AI lab (think OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You're guiding and consulting an experiment that aims to apply the results of LLM interpretability research to push forward the philosophical debate between nominalism and realism. This is a "hobby" project of a software engineers just getting started with interpretability, but interested in using LLM interpretability to push the debate as far as possible with the tools available.

We are analysing layer-by-layer logit-lens sweeps over ten open-weight base LLMs (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Meta-Llama-3-70B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Mistral-Small-24B-Base-2501, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-27B, Qwen-3-8B, Qwen-3-14B, Qwen2.5-72B, Yi-34B).

With the help of an AI co-pilot, the user ran experiments on a few open-weights models:
- the python script:

- structured output of the script for each of the models in JSON (model-level results) and CSV (detailed layer-by-layer results) files:

Your task is to:
- review the experiment's code: anything wrong about the approach (other than limitations highlighted in model evaluation docs)?
- review the results and analyses: anything incorrectly interpreted, over-stated, or missed?
- do your own independent deep dive into the results, broadly following the structure of cross-model evaluation reports, and using your knowledge of latest LLM interpretability research (you may use search for articles, posts and code sources);
- consider the usefulness of the findings for the realism vs nominalism debate, keeping in mind this is just the first iteration;
- review the plan in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forms-and-features/logos-in-layers/refs/heads/main/PROJECT_NOTES.md and, if necessary, propose additions and/or adjustments to the next steps, keeping in mind project context and goals; make sure that suggestions would actually bring non-negligible value to the project (no bike-shedding!).

Use your knowledge of cutting-edge LLM research. Look up and read papers, if necessary.

Be thorough and specific - this is important.

Make sure that statements are supported by evidence from the txt dump, don't speculate. Contextualize your findings using your broader knowledge of the latest interpretability research, citing sources when appropriate. Always provide links to sources, and verify that sources contain the claims that you're citing; otherwise, reformulate or remove the claim. In any case, never provide a non-existent source.

Do not use tables unless for the cases explicitly requested in this prompt.

Known limitations of the approach that we accepted in this iteration (but suggestions are appreciated):

The script:
* **Applies each model's own normaliser** (RMSNorm for RMS models, LayerNorm for LN models) to every residual stream before projecting through the model's unembedding matrix.
* **Defines copy-collapse (L\_copy) by prompt-echo**: the first layer whose top-1 *next-token* (or a k=1 window) forms an ID-level contiguous subsequence of the prompt's token IDs with **p > 0.95** and margin **p1 − p2 > 0.10**. No entropy fallback; whitespace/punctuation top‑1s are ignored. We deliberately abandoned the earlier "entropy < 1 bit" rule because entropy is vocabulary-size sensitive and produced inconsistent collapse depths. Provenance fields are present in diagnostics (`copy_thresh`, `copy_window_k`, `copy_match_level`).
* **Defines semantic-collapse (L\_semantic)** as the first layer whose top-1 equals the gold answer token ("Berlin").  Δ-collapse = L\_semantic − L\_copy captures how long the model clings to surface form before retrieving meaning.
* Uses a single fixed prompt
  `Give the city name only, plain text. The capital of Germany is called simply`
  followed by the logit-lens sweep of the next unseen token ("⟨NEXT⟩").
  The brevity instruction intentionally stresses instruction-following pathways; removing it is known to shift collapse depths but that comparison is out-of-scope here.
* Runs on the device selected by `--device` (default **CUDA**).  Residual streams are cached in float-32; the un-embedding matrix is promoted to FP-32 only when the model itself is loaded in FP-32 (CPU path).  The run is deterministically seeded (`SEED = 316`) so ranking ties are reproducible.  Early-layer token decoding may produce garbled Unicode—treat these artefacts as noise.
* Outputs three artefacts per model: a JSON meta file (diagnostics + summary), a full-sequence CSV ("records") and a pure-next-token CSV (one row per layer) that now includes the flags `copy_collapse`, `entropy_collapse` (legacy) and `is_answer`.

Known limitations to keep in mind:

* RMS-lens can distort absolute probabilities; comparisons should stay within-model, not across differing normalisation schemes.
* Single-prompt probing risks over-fitting to tokenizer quirks; copy-collapse counts may swing if we tweak wording or punctuation.
* Attention patterns and MLP activations are not inspected—only residual projections—so entropy bumps caused by internal gating may be mis-attributed.

Accept these constraints as *scoping guards*: they keep this run self-consistent even if they leave some systematic bias uncorrected.

Your response should read as a review, not as part of a conversation. DO NOT refer to user as "you", or to yourself as "I" - everything in the review MUST be in third person. The review should be in valid markdown format. Respond with review only and nothing else, no dialogue.
